# üëã Hi - I'm Amol
Over the last 10 years I‚Äôve worked on building [ML-based solutions for chemical synthesis](https://github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder), [systems for automatic activity recognition](https://research.ibm.com/projects/lab-that-learns), and [LLM's for text2sql](https://research.ibm.com/projects/flowpilot).

This has influenced how [medicines](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/md/d3md00651d) and [agrochemicals](https://shootsbysyngenta.com/success-story-ibm-and-syngenta) are made across large organisations.

# About

My experience spans the full development lifecycle - from lab-based research to the design, deployment, and productionisation of AI tools for both early-stage discovery and scale-up. I'm particularly interested in translating research into the real world, especially via commercial entities, whether industry or start-ups. I plan on writing some thoughts on the matter so check back for a link later.

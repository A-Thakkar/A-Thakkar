# ðŸ‘‹ Hi
Over the last 10 years Iâ€™ve worked on building [ML-based solutions for chemical synthesis](https://github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder), [systems for automatic activity recognition](https://research.ibm.com/projects/lab-that-learns), and [LLM's for text2sql](https://research.ibm.com/projects/flowpilot).

This has influenced how [medicines](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/md/d3md00651d) and [agrochemicals](https://shootsbysyngenta.com/success-story-ibm-and-syngenta) are made across large organisations.

#### Now, I'm looking for a new adventure.

If youâ€™re working on a problem, and need a proactive partner willing to take on challenges across building, management, and working with clients, i'd love to chat.

I'm particularly interested in opportunities which involve:
- Research where there is direct view to improving a product/service
- Translational work
    - Applying technology to improve a product/service
    - Working directly with clients/users
- Applied Data Science, Research, AI
